# Local Server

To run a local server, you need to have installed `query`, `query-server` and `esbuild` with a global or local installation. Please, check the [Install](/docs/install.html) section for more information.

Also, the minimum configuration in the `Query.toml` file and the `.env` file is required. Please, check the [Configuration](/docs/configuration.html) section for more information.

Once you have installed the dependencies and configured the files, you can run the server with the following command:

```sh
query dev
```

Or

```sh
pnpm query dev
```

Or

```sh
npx query dev
```

The server will start and you can access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
