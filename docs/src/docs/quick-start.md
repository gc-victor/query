# Quick Start

To create a new project, run the following command:

```sh
pnpm dlx @qery/query create 
```

Or

```sh
npx @qery/query create
```

You will have three options:

- **application**: A project with a basic structure to create a web application.
- **counter**: A basic project with a counter function.
- **minimal**: A minimal project with a single server function.

Choose the one that best fits your needs and follow the instructions. It will create a new directory with the project structure and install the necessary dependencies.

After creating the project, the command will print the following steps to run the project.

```sh
cd my-project
```

AND

```sh
pnpm query dev
```

OR

```sh
npx query dev
```

That's it. In less than a minute, you will be able to see the project running at <http://localhost:3000>.
