## Run A Query Server on Fly.io

We recommend use Query with Fly (<https://fly.io>). It will help you to deploy your server in a few minutes and replicate your databases across the world.

You can use Query as an isolated service or you can use it as a service with a proxy to your App. We will see both options.

### Query As An Isolated Service

Query allows you to set a service with authentication to access remote SQLite databases and possibility to use [Query CLI](https://github.com/gc-victor/query/blob/main/README.md#cli), [Query API](https://github.com/gc-victor/query/blob/main/README.md#apis) and  [Query Studio](https://github.com/gc-victor/query-studio).

### How to use it

Your Dockerfile must include the Query Server. The Dockerfile could be a multistage one, where the last stage should be an `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` compatible image. We recommend using a `debian:<suite>-slim` image.

Please refer to the [LiteFS documentation](https://fly.io/docs/litefs/speedrun/) for more information, as it is a crucial system component.

Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM debian:12-slim

COPY litefs.yml /etc/litefs.yml
COPY --from=flyio/litefs:0.5 /usr/local/bin/litefs /usr/local/bin/litefs

RUN apt-get update -qq && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    ca-certificates \
    sqlite3 \
    fuse3 \
    curl

# Download and installs Query Server
RUN curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/gc-victor/query/releases/latest/download/query-server-installer.sh | sh

# It will execute the Query Server and your App
COPY process.sh process.sh
RUN chmod +x process.sh

# Queries databases path
ENV QUERY_SERVER_DBS_PATH="/mnt/dbs"

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["litefs", "mount"]
```

process.sh:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

/root/.cargo/bin/query-server
```

litefs.yml:

```yml
...
exec:
  - cmd: "./process.sh"
...
```

### Query Server With Proxy

Query allows you to set a proxy to an App in the same VM. It provides you access to the databases directly from your application while enjoying the benefits of using Query, such as [Query CLI](https://github.com/gc-victor/query/blob/main/README.md#cli), [Query API](https://github.com/gc-victor/query/blob/main/README.md#apis) and  [Query Studio](https://github.com/gc-victor/query-studio).

### How to use it

In your Dockerfile, you must include the Query Server and your Application together. The Dockerfile could be a multistage one, where the last stage should be an `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` compatible image. We recommend using a `debian:<suite>-slim` image.

For this example, we will use Bun as our App. You can use any other language or framework.

Please refer to the [LiteFS documentation](https://fly.io/docs/litefs/speedrun/) for more information, as it is a crucial system component.

Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM debian:12-slim AS runtime

COPY litefs.yml /etc/litefs.yml
COPY --from=flyio/litefs:0.5 /usr/local/bin/litefs /usr/local/bin/litefs

RUN apt-get update -qq && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    ca-certificates \
    sqlite3 \
    fuse3 \
    curl

# Download and installs Query Server
RUN curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/gc-victor/query/releases/latest/download/query-server-installer.sh | sh

# It will execute the Query Server and your App
COPY process.sh process.sh
RUN chmod +x process.sh

# Queries databases path
ENV QUERY_SERVER_DBS_PATH="/mnt/dbs"
# Enable Query Server Proxy
ENV QUERY_SERVER_PROXY="true"
# Your App port
ENV QUERY_SERVER_PROXY_PORT="3001"

# DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO INSTALL YOUR APP

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["litefs", "mount"]
```

For multi-process applications, you can use the "Just use Bash", as we do in this example, to start the Query Server and your App. [Fly proposes](https://fly.io/docs/app-guides/multiple-processes/) different ways to manage multiple processes, so please use the one you feel more comfortable with.

process.sh:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -m
/root/.cargo/bin/query-server &
__START_YOUR_APP__ &
fg %1
```

Please, change `__START_YOUR_APP__` with the command to start your App.

litefs.yml:

```yml
...
exec:
  - cmd: "./process.sh"
...
```

Please, visit the example/proxy folder to see a working example. You will have to rename the `fly.toml.dist` to `fly.toml` to be able to deploy it and follow the steps from [Run a Query Server](https://github.com/gc-victor/query?tab=readme-ov-file#run-a-query-server) to finalize the process.

### Query Server App

Removing the `/_/function` prefix using an environment variable is possible. This can be useful when using the Query Server to serve Pages and APIs. You can set this configuration using the following environment variable:

```sh
QUERY_SERVER_APP=true
```

You can now access pages using `/rest_of_the_path` instead of `/_/function/pages/rest_of_the_path`. Similarly, APIs will be `/api/rest_of_the_path` instead of `/_/function/api/rest_of_the_path`. As usual, every function will be served using the `/_/function` prefix.

It is important to note that the `QUERY_SERVER_APP` environment variable is optional. The`/_/function` path will be used for every case if you don't provide it.

[More information about the Function feature](#function).

### Fly configuration

If it is the first time using Fly, you can follow the [Hands-on with Fly.io](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/) guide to install the CLI, sign up and sign in.

Once you have the Fly CLI installed, you have to rename the `fly.toml.dist` to `fly.toml`, and update it with your app name and the primary region running the following command:

```sh
fly launch
```

It is time to set the environment variables for your app. You can do it running the following commands:

Token secret:

```sh
fly secrets set QUERY_SERVER_TOKEN_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

> **Note**: If you don't have openssl installed, you can also use
> [1Password](https://1password.com/password-generator) to generate a random
> secret, just replace `$(openssl rand -hex 32)` with the generated secret.

Admin email:

```sh
fly secrets set QUERY_SERVER_ADMIN_EMAIL=USE_YOUR_EMAIL
```

Admin password:

```sh
fly secrets set QUERY_SERVER_ADMIN_PASSWORD=USE_A_SECURE_PASSWORD
```

We use LiteFS, a Fly addon that provides a simple way to replicate your SQLite databases in the cloud. To use LiteFS you need to configure consul. You can do it running the following commands:

```sh
fly consul attach
```

For the backups of your databases you have to create a LiteFS Cloud cluster in [the LiteFS section](https://fly.io/dashboard/personal/litefs) of the fly.io dashboard. Take note of your auth token (youâ€™ll need it later). LiteFS Cloud is optional, but highly recommended if your data is important to you!

```sh
fly secrets set LITEFS_CLOUD_TOKEN=YOUR_LITEFS_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKEN
```

Then you can deploy your app running:

```sh
fly deploy
```

Your app is currently running on a single machine. To ensure high availability, especially for production apps, Fly strongly recommend running at least 2 instances. You can scale up the number of machines using the `fly machine clone` command in the CLI. Please, have in mind that you can add that machine to an other region.

```sh
fly m clone
```

Or

```sh
fly m clone --select --region A_REGION
```

*Example: `fly m clone --select --region lhr`* (London)

To get a list of rigions you can run the following command:

```sh
fly platform regions
```

## CLI

### Install

#### Use The Installer Scripts

npm package:

```sh
npm install -g @qery/query
```

OR

```sh
pnpm install -g @qery/query
```

macOS and Linux (not NixOS, Alpine, or Asahi):

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/gc-victor/query/releases/latest/download/query-installer.sh | sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://github.com/gc-victor/query/releases/latest/download/query-installer.ps1 | iex
```

#### Download The Binary

<https://github.com/gc-victor/query/releases/latest>

### Dev

To run the development mode, you have to run the following command:

```sh
query dev
```

It will run the query-server and watch the changes in the files in the `dist`, `src` and `public` folders. If you change a file, it will push them to server.

### Configuration

The configuration file is located in the **/.query** folder. It is a TOML file named **Query\.toml**. The file format is as follows:

```toml
[server]
url = "http://localhost:3000"

[structure]
functions_folder = "src"
migrations_folder = "migrations"

[esbuild]
"loader:.html" = "text"
"loader:.svg" = "text"
```

#### Options

- **server** - The settings of the server to deploy
  - **url** - The URL of the server to deploy. It will be requested during the settings process
- **structure** - The structure of the project
  - **migrations_folder** - The folder where the migrations are stored. (Default: src/migrations)
  - **functions_folder** - The folder where the functions are stored. (Default: src/functions)
  - **templates_folder** - The folder where the templates are stored. (Default: templates)
- **esbuild** - The esbuild CLI params configuration for the functions. You can find more information in the [esbuild documentation](https://esbuild.github.io/api/).



### Commands

Following we will see the commands you can use with the CLI.

#### Settings

Lets start by adding the settings of your server.

```sh
query settings
```

It will ask you the following questions:

##### URL

- What is the server URL?

You can use a local one for development, or if you want to use Fly for your development deploys or access your remote databases, you can run the following command to get your Fly URL:

```sh
fly status
```

You will have to use the Hostname plus as a prefix the protocol `https://`.

*Example: `https://query-server.fly.dev`*

Where `query-server.fly.dev` is the Hostname.

##### Login

You need to log in to get the token to connect to your Query Server. The token will be saved in the `.query/.token` file.

```

### Generator

Query's generator is a tool that helps you create a set of files using a simple command that represents a table's structure. It lets you quickly and easily create the needed files without writing everything from scratch.

Example:

```sh
query generator blog.sql post title:string content:text
```

Format:

```sh
query generator <DATABA> <TABLE> <COLUMNS[COLUMN:TYPE]>
```

#### Column Types

The following table illustrates the mapping between Column Types, TypeScript, and SQLite data types:

| ColumnType | TypeScript | SQLite  |
|------------|------------|---------|
| blob       | Blob       | BLOB    |
| boolean    | boolean    | BOOLEAN |
| number     | number     | INTEGER |
| integer    | number     | INTEGER |
| float      | number     | REAL    |
| real       | number     | REAL    |
| timestamp  | string     | INTEGER DEFAULT (strftime('%s', 'now')) |
| string     | string     | TEXT    |
| text       | string     | TEXT    |
| uuid       | string     | TEXT UNIQUE CHECK ({column_name} != '') DEFAULT (uuid()) |

#### How it works

The generator does two things:

- Generate the database migrations files to update your database
- Generate a set of files based on templates

##### Database migrations

The migration generated will use the command to create the table and the columns. The migration will be stored in the **/migrations** folder inside a folder with the database name (Ex. blog.sql). It will generate two files with the format of **`<version>_<name>_<type>.sql`**. The version will have the format of YYYYMMDDHHMMSS, the name should be in the format of `<name>_<description>`, and the types will be **up** and **down**.

You can find more information about migrations in the [Migration](#migration) section.

##### Templates

The templates used to generate files are stored in the **/templates** folder or a custom folder specified in the Query's config file.

```toml
[structure]
templates_folder = other-template-folder
```

Query uses a basic template system that we will describe in detail below.

There are some dynamic variables based on the command params that you can use to generate the file content:

- **{{ database }}**: The database where the migration will be executed
- **{{ table }}**<sup>1</sup>: The name of the table
- **{{ columnsLength }}**: The number of the columns
- **{{ columns }}**: The list of columns specified
  - **{{ columnIndex }}**: The index value in the loop
  - **{{ columnFirst }}**: The first column in the loop
  - **{{ columnLast }}**: The last column in the loop
  - **{{ columnName }}**<sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup>: The name of the column
  - **{{ columnTypeMatchTS }}**: The match of the type of the column with the TypeScript type
  - **{{ columnsListOfUniqueTSTypes }}**: A list of the matches between column type and TypeScript type in lowercase
  - **{{ columnType }}**<sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup>: The type of the column

<sub>1 The table, the columnName, and the columnType have name variants you can use in your templates.</sub>

<sub>2 To get the columnName and columnType, it is required to iterate over the columns.</sub>

As we have commented, you can use some name variants in your templates for the table, columnName, and columnType. The name variants are based on the command that you will use to generate the files.

**Variants:**

- **camelCase** (Ex. testName)
- **hyphenCase** (Ex. test-name)
- **snakeCase** (Ex. test_name)
- **dotCase** (Ex. test.name)
- **pathCase** (Ex. test/name)
- **constantCase** (Ex. TEST_NAME)
- **pascalCase** (Ex. TestName)
- **capitalCase** (Ex. Test Name)
- **lowerCase** (Ex. test name)
- **sentenceCase** (Ex. Test name)
- **upperCase** (Ex. TEST NAME)
- **upperCaseFirst** (Ex. Test name)
- **lowerCaseFirst** (Ex. test name)

**Variables:**

```tmpl
{{ tableCamelCase }}
{{ tableHyphenCase }}
{{ tableSnakeCase }}
{{ tableDotCase }}
{{ tablePathCase }}
{{ tableConstantCase }}
{{ tablePascalCase }}
{{ tableCapitalCase }}
{{ tableLowerCase }}
{{ tableSentenceCase }}
{{ tableUpperCase }}
{{ tableUpperCaseFirst }}
{{ tableLowerCaseFirst }}
{{ columnNameCamelCase }}
{{ columnNameHyphenCase }}
{{ columnNameSnakeCase }}
{{ columnNameDotCase }}
{{ columnNamePathCase }}
{{ columnNameConstantCase }}
{{ columnNamePascalCase }}
{{ columnNameCapitalCase }}
{{ columnNameLowerCase }}
{{ columnNameSentenceCase }}
{{ columnNameUpperCase }}
{{ columnNameUpperCaseFirst }}
{{ columnNameLowerCaseFirst }}
{{ columnTypeCamelCase }}
{{ columnTypeHyphenCase }}
{{ columnTypeSnakeCase }}
{{ columnTypeDotCase }}
{{ columnTypePathCase }}
{{ columnTypeConstantCase }}
{{ columnTypePascalCase }}
{{ columnTypeCapitalCase }}
{{ columnTypeLowerCase }}
{{ columnTypeSentenceCase }}
{{ columnTypeUpperCase }}
{{ columnTypeUpperCaseFirst }}
{{ columnTypeLowerCaseFirst }}
```

The template system provides two operations to use in your templates:

**If:**

```html
{% if table == "post" %}
  <p>This is a Post.</p>
{% else %}
  <p>This isn't a Post.</p>
{% endif %}
```

**For:**

```html
{% for column in columns %}
  <p>{% column.columnName %}</p>
{% endfor %}
```

With the previous information, you can create a set of files based on the table's schema. These files should be placed in the templates folder, with the folder structure used to generate files in their respective locations. The templates folder structure should match that of the *functions_folder*, which is typically configured as */src*, although you will need to configure it yourself. You can find more information about the configuration process in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

Example from the [query-app](https://github.com/gc-victor/query-app) project:

Notice that the **"\*\*"** is a placeholder for that will be replaced by the table name of the command.

### Function

A function is a JavaScript function that is executed in the Query Server and it has access to the databases.

The function should be in the format of:

```js
export async function handleRequest(req) {
    return new Response("This is the body!", {
      status: 200,
      headers: {
          "content-type": "text/plain",
      },
  });
}
```

The function has to export a function called `handleRequest` that receives a [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and returns a [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response).

To use a database you have to create a connection to the database:

```js
const db = new Database("example.sql");
```

The `Database` constructor receives the name of the database. If the database is found, it will create a connection to the database. It will provide the following methods:

- `query` - To read data from the database.
- `execute` - To write data in the database.

A `query` and an `execute` can have params. The params are bound to the parameters based on the order of the array or an object with the format of `:AAA`, `$AAA`, or `@AAA` that serve as placeholders for values that are bound to the parameters at a later time. The params are optional.

As Query uses [LiteFS proxy](https://fly.io/docs/litefs/config/#http-proxy-server), you have to remember to use `GET` to read data and `DELETE|POST|PUT|PATCH` to write data.

#### Handle Request Example

```js
// get.index.js
export async function handleRequest(req) {
    const db = new Database("example.sql");

    const result = await db.query("SELECT * FROM example WHERE id = ?", [1]);

    return new Response(JSON.stringify({data: result}), {
      status: 200,
      headers: {
          "content-type": "application/json",
      },
  });
}
```

Query CLI provides an API to resolving routes against file-system paths and using the file names. To use functions it is required to follow the next structure:

#### Folder Structure Example

```sh
functions
â”œâ”€â”€ get.index.js // GET "/"
â”œâ”€â”€ post.index.js // POST "/"
â”œâ”€â”€ example
    â”œâ”€â”€ get.index.js // GET "/example"
    â””â”€â”€ get.[slug].js // GET "/example/:slug"
â”œâ”€â”€ [slug]
    â””â”€â”€ get.index.js  // GET "/:slug"
...
```

By default the folder to contain the functions has to be called `functions`. You can use another one by pointing to it, but we will explain it with more detail below.

It is important to note that the method used in a file is determined by the prefix `(delete|get|patch|post|put).*`, while the remaining part of the file name defines the final segment of the route. For instance, if the file name ends with `index`, it will be the root of the route, and if it is `[slug]`, it will be a route with a slug. The slug is a placeholder for a value used in the route.

To define the different segments of the route, you must use the folder structure. For example, if you want to use the path `/example/:slug`, you have to create a folder called `example` and inside it a file called `get.[slug].js`. If you want to use the route `/:slug`, you have to create a folder called `[slug]` and inside of it a file called `get.index.js`. If you want to use the route `/`, you must create a file called `get.index.js`.

#### Query Cache Control

The Query Server has a feature that helps avoid compiling functions that have not been modified, which in turn speeds up each response. This feature is managed using the `Query-Cache-Control` header and specifying the `max-age`, in milliseconds, in the header response of the `handleRequest` function. The function response is stored in the `cache_function` table of the `query_cache_function.sql` database. If needed, the cache can be purged by either deleting the row related to a path or by deleting the entire cache from the `cache_function` table.

```js
// get.index.js
export async function handleRequest(req) {
    const db = new Database("example.sql");

    const result = await db.query("SELECT * FROM example WHERE id = ?", [1]);

    return new Response(JSON.stringify({data: result}), {
      status: 200,
      headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
          "Query-Cache-Control": "max-age=3600000", // 1 hour
      },
  });
}
```

#### Usage

Query uses under the hood [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) to bundle the functions. So, first you have to install esbuild globally:

```sh
npm install --global esbuild
```

Or

```sh
pnpm install --global esbuild
```

To use the functions you have to run the following command:

```sh
query function <PATH>
```

The path is optional. If you don't provide it, it will use the default path `functions`. You can use the path to point to another folder or a function file.

#### Example

```sh
query function
```

It will deploy all the functions to the Query Server. A simple cache is implemented to avoid deploying functions that have not changed.

```sh
query function another-functions-folder
```

It will deploy all the functions in the `another-functions-folder` folder to the Query Server.

```sh
query function functions/get.index.js
```

It will deploy the `get.index.js` function to the Query Server.

```sh
query function functions/get.index.js --delete
```

It will delete the `get.index.js` function from the Query Server.

### Asset

Query CLI offers an API that enables users to upload assets to the Query Server. These assets are uploaded to the `query_asset.sql` database and are served in the path `/_/asset/name` or `/_/asset/name_hashed`. The names of the assets are kept in the database as `name` and `name_hashed`. The `name` is the original name of the asset, while the `name_hashed` is a hashed name of the asset, which the hash is based on its content, with the format `dog-000.png`. They have different `Cache-Control` configurations. The `name` has a `Cache-Control` of `public, max-age=300, must-revalidate`, while the `name_hashed` has a `Cache-Control` of `public, max-age=31536000, immutable`.

Usage:

```sh
query asset [OPTIONS] <PATH>
```

Example:

```sh
query asset ./assets
```

Options:

- `-a, --active <ACTIVE>` - Activate status of the asset [default: true]  
- `-d, --delete` - Delete the asset It is mandatory to provide the path to the asset
- `-p, --path <PATH>` - Path to the assets
- `-h, --help` - Print help

## APIs

Following we will see the API endpoints you can use with the Query Server.

### Query Endpoint

The `query` endpoint allows to execute queries in the databases. Using the `GET` method, the query is executed in the database closest to the user's region, thanks to the LiteFS proxy. Using the `POST` method, the query is executed in the primary database.

#### POST

The `query` endpoint allows to execute a query in the primary database.

```http
POST /_/query
```

##### Headers

| Name | Type | Description | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| `query` | `string` | The query to execute. | true |
| `params` | `object` \| `array` | The params to use in the query. | false |

The params object should use kyes with the format ":AAA", "$AAA", or "@AAA" that serve as placeholders for values that are bound to the parameters at a later time.

Example:

```json
{
  "db_name": "example.sql",
  "query": "SELECT * FROM example WHERE id = :id",
  "params": {
    ":id": 1
  }
}

}
```

The branches has this format: `<db_name>.<branch_name>.branch.sql`. For example, if the database name is `example.sql` and the branch name is `dev`, the branch will be `example.dev.branch.sql`. Notice that the extension is removed from the database name to be used as a prefix.

#### GET

The branch endpoint allows to get a list of all the branches.

```http
GET /_/branch
```

##### Headers

| Name | Type | Description | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
